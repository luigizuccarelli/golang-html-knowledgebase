**Mounting the go-build and golangci-lint cache files**

- If you are experiencing problems with mounting the cache directories
in the container to speed up linting and building, try doing the following (this is specifically for SELinux enabled OS's)

```bash
# check chcon settings
ls -LZ <pv-directory-for-cache>/.cache/go-build
# it should have the following settings 
# system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0
# update if not
sudo chcon -R system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0 <pv-directory-for-cache>/.cache/go-build
# repeat for golangci-lint
```
- In fact if you have any problems with mounting any other directory check the SELinux
settings and apply the *system_u:object_r:container_file_t:s0* via chcon


check the tekton-pipeline project on kind/ocp
ensure the pod tekton-triggers-core-interceptors is running (user 65532 is a problem)

ensure sa pipeline is tied to a clusterrolebinding i.e edit or admin

podman clean

podman rmi -f $(podman images | grep '^<none>'  | awk '{print $3}' )

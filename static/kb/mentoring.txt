Hi Angela, I have been reading about servant leadership and mentoring (how to be a mentor and how to be mentored) . I wanted to get a sounding off you first, this is just a suggestion, I know its still early days and there is still a way to go for our team.  I am currently building a list of people I'm going to ask to mentor me. I also have noted in our team who I intern could mentor
